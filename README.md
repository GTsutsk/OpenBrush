# OpenBrush
OpenBrush is an open-source electric toothbrush that is sustainable, repairable and customisable. 

Conventional electric toothbrushes often consist of glued or welded components that make them impossible to repair and difficult to dispose of.
This is where OpenBrush comes in: By using standardised electronic components and 3D-printed housing parts, anyone can manufacture, adapt and repair the toothbrush themselves.
The components are easily accessible and the housing can be printed or ordered as a kit. If a repair is necessary, individual parts can be easily replaced. 
The construction plans are freely available so that users can download them, build the toothbrush themselves or share their own improvements.
OpenBrush shows that sustainable design is also possible for everyday products - a contribution to the circular economy and the open source hardware movement.

So dive in, try out and share your improvements.
