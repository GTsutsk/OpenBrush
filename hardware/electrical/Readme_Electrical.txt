Electrical logic of the electric toothbrushes are not very complex.

This subfolder can be used to design and share custom PCB designs for controlling the brush.
This can be a single button latch circuit with 6 x 30s timer for reminding the user of the duration of the cleaning process.

For sonic toothbrushes an oscillator circuit is required for driving the oscillator motor at 500 Hz which corresponds to 30000 brushstrokes
